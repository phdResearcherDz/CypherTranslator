In this study, our objective was to conduct a thorough evaluation of our approach. A significant challenge we faced was the lack of an appropriate question set for our knowledge bases. To overcome this, we utilized the BioASQ Task 11B Phase B test dataset~\cite{bioasq}, which provides a collection of pertinent biomedical questions. Our focus was on "List" type questions due to their compatibility with the knowledge base's response format, in contrast to yes/no or summary answer types. For each knowledge graph used as an answer source, we selected questions with potential responses within the graph. This involved extracting key subject entities from the questions and verifying their presence in the KG.
